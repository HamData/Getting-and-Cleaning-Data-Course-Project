###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

I created his repo to completed the week for project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  The purpose of this task was to download a zip file into the working directory.  Then to use the data via r code to create a tidy file.

####Description of Data

The variables in the X data are measurements taken with waist-mounted smartphones.  The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

####Description of Code

The code combines the test and training datasets and partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.  The new dataset has variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset average each type of activity for all participants.

#### Project Instructions for Code were as follows 
(reference: Coursera Project Instructions Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data)

Create Code that: 

1.Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.<br />
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br />
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br />
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br />
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
